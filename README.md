# Iris-Classification
🌺🔍 Iris Species Classification Project in Python

📊 In this project, I utilized Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and TensorFlow to perform Iris species classification.

🔍 Data Exploration and Preparation:

Loaded the Iris dataset using Pandas.
Explored the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
Preprocessed the data by dropping unnecessary columns and scaling features.

📈 Data Visualization:

Visualized relationships between features using Seaborn's pairplot to gain insights into the data distribution.

🛠 Model Building with TensorFlow:

Built a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API with Sequential layers.
Compiled the model with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer.
Trained the model on the training data for 100 epochs.

📉 Model Evaluation:

Plotted training history to visualize accuracy and loss over epochs.
Evaluated the model's performance on the test set, achieving an accuracy of [insert accuracy]%.

📊 Confusion Matrix Visualization:

Generated a confusion matrix using Seaborn to visualize the model's classification performance on the test data.
🚀 This project demonstrates a practical implementation of machine learning techniques for species classification, showcasing the power of Python and TensorFlow for data analysis and modeling tasks.
